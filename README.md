Collective notes for courses I have taken

---

Specifically, this repository contains (or refers to) notes of the following courses:

## University of Michigan

- MATH 593, *Algebra I* (2023 Fall), taught by [Prof. Mircea Mustaţă](http://www-personal.umich.edu/~mmustata/). Notes for individual chapters can be found [here](https://github.com/ARessegetesStery/MATH593-Notes).

- MATH 636, *Outer Automorphism Groups of Free Groups* (2023 Fall), taught by [Prof. Alex Wright](https://websites.umich.edu/~alexmw). In class we collective constructed the [course notes](https://websites.umich.edu/~alexmw/Math636Notes.pdf), so I do not bother to make my own.
